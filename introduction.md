# Introduction

MHCalendar is a powerful, framework-agnostic calendar component built with **StencilJS**. It compiles to standard **Web Components**, allowing you to use it seamlessly in any web project, from vanilla JavaScript to modern frameworks like **React**, **Vue**, or **Angular**.

This component provides a large, interactive calendar where users can visualize schedules, manage appointments, and plan ahead with a rich user experience out of the box.

### Core Features:

*   🗓️ **Three Essential Views**: Easily switch between a detailed `Day` view, a weekly `Week` view, or a big-picture `Month` view.
*   👆 **Intuitive Drag & Drop**: Effortlessly create, move, and resize events directly on the calendar, making scheduling feel natural and fast.
*   🎨 **Unmatched Styling Flexibility**: We believe your components should match your brand. Style MHCalendar to your exact specifications using either traditional CSS or dynamic CSS-in-JS objects.

This documentation will guide you through the installation, configuration, and customization of MHCalendar to get you up and running quickly.
